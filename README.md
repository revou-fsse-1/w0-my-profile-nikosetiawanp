# Welcome to Niko Setiawan's Profile!

## My Bio

Hi, my name is Niko. Student of RevoU Software Engineering Program.

I'm a Software Engineering Student at RevoU, and I taught myself to code 1 month ago. I follow the curriculum on The Odin Project, a free open source coding curriculum that helps students get hired as software engineer.

I aim to get hired as a software engineer, as I believe the job isn't bound by location, and can be done from anywhere in the world. Well, except places without internet access.

I hope that i could find remote job as software engineer after graduating from RevoU, so wish me luck!
